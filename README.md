# Pytorch_Practice
 Pytorch studying and practicing for Deep Learning

 Datasets Description:

 In this project, the necessary datasets are MNIST, IMDB and CELEBA.

 The MNIST and IMDB could directly downloaded from the torchvision and torchtext.

 The CELEBA could be downloaded from the Google official: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pbWNEUjJKdDQ3dGc

 For other datasets, here is the baidu cloud's link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-nmxzd4Wm7ijRpUMzRnQQA, code: rbo5

 The above link only has the datasets for Recurrent Neural Network project.

 The remaining datasets of Convolutional Neural Network would not be offered. (Neural Style Transfer and Resnet Transfer Learning)


 Library Description:

 This project only required three extra library, one is jieba, another one is nltk and the last one is torchtext.
